## Objective
This project consist of exploring given data set, designing interactive dashboard. 

## Instructions
There are two milestones in the project.
### Creating Dashboard - First Milestone
* Import the dataset using Web Data Connector. Go to Connect > To a Server > Web Data Connector and paste https://tableau.data.world/?dataset_name=covid-19-data-resource-hub%2Fcovid-19-case-counts&query=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20covid_19_activity&queryType=SQL in the box. 

* Create an interactive dashboard.

    **Note:** The dataset is not alive to be able to embed to the file. The last recod was taken at December 2021. So the gap at the end of graphs occurs.
