# Data Visualization with Tableau
## Sales Analysis of a Website with Tableau

### Overview:
<p>Visual analysis is a non-linear process. For example, a user might start with an initial task or question in mind, find relevant data, and prepare it for analysis. During analysis, she/he realizes that she/he needs additional data, so she/he goes back a couple of steps to get more data, choose a new visual mapping, and develop new insight. This example can be repeated for any of the other steps of the cycle of visual analysis.</p>
<p>The flow of analysis is difficult or impossible to achieve in traditional BI. Instead of exploiting the power of visual cues and iteration, it is heavily milestone-driven. Requirements gathering leads to development, then to testing, and eventually to launch. With visual analysis, the steps become more fluid as the answer to one question often leads to other questions, and new insights are uncovered.</p>
